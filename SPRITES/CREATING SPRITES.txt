Use GIMP

almost all sprites are located in the sprites.XCF file

new sprites belong ONLY on the "TILES" layer

it is helpful to copy the basic 1x1x1 block piece and draw on top of it as a template

to align a block with the grid, make sure the very tip pixel of the top surface is aligned with a red grid pixel

the game engine is limited by VGA hardware, and therefore a palette of max 256 colors can be used. REUSE COLORS WHENEVER POSSIBLE!!!

use existing sprites as size reference

avoid using full green (r=0, g=255, b=0) because it is used to identify transparent selections in the engine



helpful tools/shortcuts/tips in gimp

"r" is the rectangle select tool
"o" is the color picker (FOR REUSING COLORS)
"m" for moving a pasted selection around
shift+b is the paint bucket

ctrl+x \ ctrl+c \ ctrl+v are probably going to be heavily used

when setting up the pencil tool for drawing set the size to 1, and the brush to the first one, "pixel"
when using the pencil tool, holding shift will help draw a perfect line from your last drawn pixel
when using the pencil tool, holding ctrl will allow the pencil tool to act like a color picker tool

make sure antialiasing\feathering is turned off for all tools. particularly the selection tools (rectangle select, lasso select, magic wand)
